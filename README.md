vimrc
=====

I'm a whole hearted Vim believer, to be honest I've not used any of the others, it's your job to convince me I need to. This is my prefered .vimrc file.

Debugging
=========
My favorite debugger so far is at: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4059

I'm always looking out for better debugging solutions so feel free to let me know what you find that you like.
